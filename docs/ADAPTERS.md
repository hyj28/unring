# HTTP adapters

Adapters are declarative YAML files that tell unring how to treat intercepted
HTTPS requests. They contain no Go code and use no LLM. The GitHub adapter
shipped with unring is an ordinary file in
[`internal/adapter/builtin`](../internal/adapter/builtin) and pass through the
same loader as user files.

Set `UNRING_ADAPTERS` to an OS path-list of additional files:

```sh
UNRING_ADAPTERS="$PWD/adapters/mail.yaml:$PWD/adapters/webhooks.yaml" \
  unring run -- your-agent
```

On Windows, use `;` instead of `:`. User files are evaluated before the shipped
files. The first matching rule whose `when` expression is true wins. Duplicate
adapter names, unknown YAML fields, invalid expressions, unreadable files, and
invalid schema values abort startup and name the offending file. An adapter is
never silently skipped.

## Complete example

This adapter stages one kind of notification and requires approval for other
actions on the same endpoint:

```yaml
version: 1
name: acme-notifications
rules:
  - name: async-notification
    match:
      hosts:
        - api.acme.example
        - "*.regional.acme.example"
      methods:
        - POST
      path: /v1/projects/*/actions
    when: >-
      body.kind == "notification" &&
      "x-delivery-mode" in request.headers &&
      request.headers["x-delivery-mode"] == "async"
    tier: stageable
    idempotency_key: >-
      "acme-notification:" + request.body_sha256
    response:
      status: 202
      headers:
        Content-Type: application/json
        X-Unring-Staged: "true"
      body: '{"accepted":true,"unring":{"staged":true,"real_response":false}}'
    undo:
      method: DELETE
      url: https://api.acme.example/v1/notifications/${response.id}

  - name: other-action
    match:
      hosts:
        - api.acme.example
        - "*.regional.acme.example"
      methods:
        - POST
      path: /v1/projects/*/actions
    tier: needs-approval
    idempotency_key: >-
      "acme-action:" + request.body_sha256
```

## Schema

Top-level fields:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `version` | yes | Schema version. The current and only value is `1`. |
| `name` | yes | Unique adapter name used in review and audit records. |
| `rules` | yes | Non-empty ordered list of request rules. |

Rule fields:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `name` | yes | Unique rule name within the adapter. |
| `match.hosts` | yes | Exact hostnames or `*.` suffix wildcards, without a scheme or port. |
| `match.methods` | yes | Uppercase HTTP methods. |
| `match.path` | yes | Go-style path glob. `*` matches within one path segment. |
| `when` | no | CEL boolean expression. A false result continues to the next rule. |
| `tier` | yes | `stageable` or `needs-approval`. `already-irreversible` is a review description reserved by unring and is rejected in adapter files. |
| `idempotency_key` | required for `stageable` | CEL string expression. |
| `response` | required for `stageable` | The response returned without contacting the origin. |
| `undo` | no | Best-effort compensating HTTP request plus the honest boundary shown in review. It is executed on discard only after the original action really ran. |

`response.status` must be a 2xx status. `response.headers` must include
`X-Unring-Staged: "true"` and cannot contain hop-by-hop headers.
`response.body` is a static string.

Every synthesized response must say that it is staged and not a real service
response. It should include only the minimum fields the client needs to accept
the call. Do not invent server IDs, timestamps, canonical URLs, version
numbers, or any value a later call might consume. A synthesized response should
say `ok: true` and carry unring's staged marker while deliberately claiming no
server-assigned identifier, timestamp, or resource object.

On commit, unring sends the original method, URL, headers, and body and sets the
`Idempotency-Key` header to the evaluated key. On discard, it deletes the
in-memory staged call without sending it. Request bodies are available in the
live review but are not serialized into audit JSON.

Unring disables Go's automatic request replay for every staged write. The key
is still delivered for services that honor it, but the presence of the header
never authorizes the HTTP transport to send a write twice. A transport error or
a non-2xx response is recorded as an unknown delivery outcome, because the
origin may have received the request even when unring could not confirm its
response.

`undo` accepts:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `method` | yes | Compensating HTTP method. |
| `url` | yes | Absolute compensating URL or a template that resolves to one. |
| `headers` | no | Headers added to the compensation; hop-by-hop headers are rejected. Original authorization is retained in memory for the live compensation but is never written to audit JSON. |
| `body` | no | Compensating request template. |
| `effect` | no | Exact user-facing description of what a successful compensation does. |
| `still_exists` | no | Exact user-facing description of what remains after partial compensation or if the attempt fails. |

Templates resolve deterministic `${request...}` and `${response...}` fields from
the original request and the real successful origin response. A missing field is an
error; unring never guesses a resource identifier. The built-in GitHub rule resolves
`${response.url}` from the real creation response before closing the issue. A 2xx
response is required, and a JSON response containing `ok: false` is failure even when
the HTTP status is 200.

GitHub illustrates a deliberately partial compensation. REST exposes no issue-delete
endpoint, so the built-in rule PATCHes the returned issue URL to the closed state.
The review says that the issue and its history remain. GitHub's GraphQL
`deleteIssue` requires administrator permission and is not described as ordinary
undo.

## CEL environment

CEL was selected instead of JSONPath because rules need deterministic boolean
logic across request metadata and bodies, not only value selection. Expressions
are compiled at startup. CEL has no network access and no model call.

The following values are available:

| Expression | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `request.method` | string | Uppercase HTTP method. |
| `request.url` | string | Complete intercepted URL. |
| `request.host` | string | Hostname without port. |
| `request.path` | string | Escaped URL path. |
| `request.query` | map | Query values; one value is a string, repeated values are a list. |
| `request.headers` | map | Lowercase header names to comma-joined strings. |
| `request.body_sha256` | string | Lowercase hex SHA-256 of the original body. |
| `request.body_size` | integer | Original body length in bytes. |
| `body` | dynamic | Parsed JSON object/array, parsed form map, or the raw body string. |

Guard optional map fields with CEL's `in` operator before indexing them:

```cel
"mode" in body && body.mode == "asynchronous"
```

## Fallback HTTP heuristics

Adapters run first. If no rule matches, unring forwards methods defined by HTTP
as safe (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `TRACE`) and records that they already
ran. Every other method requires explicit approval. A missing approval callback,
a declined prompt, or a classification error blocks the request; it never
quietly forwards.

Plain HTTP is still blocked and reported as un-intercepted because unring cannot
provide the same confidentiality and classification guarantees without TLS
interception. CONNECT passthrough and protocol upgrades are also listed as
un-intercepted.

## `gh` and output-dependent mutations

The per-session `gh` shim converts confidently parsed commands into the same
adapter request shape used by HTTPS interception. Tiers retain their meaning,
including for GitHub's `create-issue` rule: issue creation is
`needs-approval`, not stageable.

This distinction is required by the CLI contract. Real `gh issue create` exits
successfully and writes the new issue URL to stdout; scripts commonly consume
that value immediately. Unring cannot invent an honest URL for an issue that
does not exist, and returning success with empty stdout would falsely claim the
operation completed. A declined or non-interactively unapprovable mutation
therefore exits non-zero, writes the reason only to stderr, and emits no stdout.
Approval runs the real `gh` immediately so its exact stdout, stderr, stdin, and
exit status remain available to the caller. If that approved issue is later
discarded, compensation can close it, subject to the GitHub limitation above;
it cannot delete the issue or erase history.
